# TODO

* Put code files in this catalogue

* Write your answers to the lab questions [markdown-format](https://www.markdowntutorial.com/) in the file [inquiry.md](inquiry.md). Do copy relevant code to your answers into [inquiry.md](inquiry.md) so that both questions and answers are in context. Do not forget to push [inquiry.md](inquiry.md) after answering a question.

## How to run the code

* ``make bintree`` compiles the binary tree functions
* ``make all`` compiles the binary tree functions, compiles the regular tests and runs them and compiles the balance tests and runs them. 
* ``make tests`` runs the regular tests and the balance tests.
* ``make balance`` compiles and runs the balance tests.

PS. Force a rerun of make with the ``-B`` flag.
